    -- Gets in_cluster perimeters & areas for a lattice where clusters are labeled uniquely by nonzero integers.
    -- I have checked this function's speed using random numpy arrays of 0s and 1s.
        -- For an array of linear size 10**3, using numba is disadvantageous.
        -- However, when the linear size is increased to 10**4, the speed up is ~30x with numba applied.

    ----------

        Lattice to find in_cluster perimeters & areas for

    -------
    [0] perims : arr
